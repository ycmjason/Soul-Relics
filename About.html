	<p>
1 in 4 people will experience a mental health problem in any given year. However, although there is an increase in awareness of mental health, there is still a lack of understanding about the issue. 
	</p>
		<p>
We believe everyone has a story to tell. Yet, many stories are untold, hidden, or suppressed.
		</p>
	<p>
Soul Relics is an online platform on storytelling, objects and mental health. We are dedicated to respond to these issues using creative media and stories.
	</p>
	<p>
We anchor our memories with objects. By creating an open platform for connections to form between our individual stories, and letting each person use objects to express a fragment of past/ present personal account of mental ill health and recovery, we hope to create a collective message that transcends barriers between people, and challenges the stigma surrounding mental health.  
	</p>
<p>
Ultimately, we hope the platform will capture both unique experiences and common themes. We wish to provide a new way for people to tell and understand othersâ€™ stories. 
</p>

If you agree with the cause, please read our stories, and/or send yours.
