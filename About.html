Mission </style></h2>
<p>
1 in 4 people will experience a mental health problem in any given year. However, although there is an increase in awareness of mental health, there is still a lack of understanding about the issue. Many stories are untold, hidden, or suppressed. 
</p>
<p>
Soul Relics – the Museum of the Psyche, Objects and Personal Storytelling is dedicated to respond to the issues using art and stories. 
</p>
<p>
We anchor our memories with objects. By creating an open platform for connections to form between our individual stories, and letting each person use objects to express a fragment of past/ present personal account of mental ill health and recovery, we hope to create a collective message that transcends barriers between people, and challenges the stigma surrounding mental health. 
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, we hope the platform will capture both unique experiences and common themes. We wish to provide a new way for people to tell and understand others’ stories.
